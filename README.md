## Vibes Typeface

Vibes is a typeface designed for Arabic, as well as English languages. It was designed to be a mixture that radiates energy, flexibility, and cuteness.
It is specially designed to be used for title texts. Acknowledgements goes to Nadine Chahine, where this work wouldn't incepted without her help.
